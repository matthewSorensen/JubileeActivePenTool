Jubilee Plotter Tool
======

An actively-driven pen plotter toolhead for the [Jubilee](https://jubilee3d.com/) project.


## Limitations!

My machine's "ooze control assembly" is placed significantly lower than on a standard Jubilee, so I have
enough room to mount the motor/pulley assembly on the top bar, directly under the tool dock. In that
configuration, a stock 600mm spring guide is comfortably long enough to cover the full build area. However,
on a stock machine that requires the motor/pulley assembly to be mounted on the lower extrusion, a
longer (650mm?) spring guide is probably a good idea.

At the moment, I'm using a silly large stepper motor - this design is probably compatible with
a smaller "pancake" style stepper, but that is untested at the moment.

## Printed Parts

Print one of each stl in the *meshes* folder in PLA using the [standard Jubilee settings](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=3D_Printed_Parts)
and the provided orientation. Or not, you're a responsible adult and can choose part orientation and
printer settings.

## Instructions

Nope, not yet. Ask me on discord - maybe I'll take more photos of the pulley wire routing?
